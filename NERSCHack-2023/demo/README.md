# Demo simulation

One of our base simulations for this hackathon is the 3x2v p=1 LAPD gyrokinetic
simulation (see E. Shi et al., "Gyrokinetic continuum simulation of turbulence in
a straight open-field-line plasma", *Journal of Plasma Physics*,
**83**, 1â€“27 (2017)) on one GPU. We provide an input file and a Perlmutter job
script in this folder. This simulation takes about 8 hours on one NVIDIA A100 GPU
to enter the turbulent stage. A faster case can be run by one or more of the
following:
- Commenting out ```coll``` Lua tables in each of the electron and ion tables.
  This turns off collisions, and should reach 5 ms in about 2.4 hours on an A100.
- Reducing ```finalTime``` and ```numFrames``` proportionally.
- Reducing the resolution (```cells```). This may not be advised since we
  haven't tested this sim at lower res yet.
