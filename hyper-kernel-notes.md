notes for running HyperDisCont kernel via unit test (use `~/gkylsoft/gkyl/bin/gkyl Unit/test_HyperDisContCuda.lua`):
- all input parameters have been moved to top of `test_1` function and commented. this now also includes `numThreads` for HyperDisCont kernel configuration. no need to re-compile after making changes in this file.
- `maxrregcount` parameter can be changed at compile time by modifying the `nvcc` command in `waf_tools/cutools.py`. need to re-compile with `./waf build install` after changing this.
- the HyperDisCont kernel currently needs to be hard-coded to a specific Vlasov equation type at compile time. for now, this can only be changed via the kernel object near the bottom of `Eq/GkylVlasov.h`. as checked-in, it is hard-coded to 1x 2v p=2 serendipity basis. this needs to match the parameters in the unit test.
- the `__global__ void cuda_HyperDisCont` kernel (in `Updater/HyperDisContDevice.cu`) calls volume and surface functions via `kernel.volTerm(...)` and `kernel.surfTerm(...)` calls. these kernel member functions are defined in `Eq/GkylVlasov.cpp`. these kernel functions call into `__device__` functions that live in files `Eq/vlasovData/Vlasov*Ser*1x2vP2.cpp`. there are these families of volume/surface files in `Eq/vlasovData` for every dimensionality and polynomial order, with increasing complexity. this is where the bulk of the computation is done.
